# Space Shooter - Version 0.4.0 Release Notes

## Performance Enhanced Release

Release Date: 2025-04-15

### Key Features

- Implemented sprite batch rendering system to dramatically reduce draw calls
- Added intelligent detection and grouping of similar sprites
- Integrated batch statistics monitoring for performance analysis
- Added toggleable controls for batch rendering and statistics display
- Enhanced performance for scenarios with many similar sprites (bullets, enemies)
- Improved rendering pipeline efficiency
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing rendering optimizations
- Added special handling for sprites that cannot be batched
- Improved debug visualization options

### Technical Improvements

- **Sprite Batch Rendering**

  - Added automatic grouping of sprites with identical images
  - Implemented batch-specific dirty rectangle optimization
  - Added minimum batch size threshold for optimal performance
  - Created special handling for transparent or rotating sprites
  - Implemented performance metrics tracking for batching
  - Added toggleable batch statistics visualization

- **Rendering Pipeline**

  - Optimized sprite drawing with reduced draw calls
  - Enhanced performance for particle effects and bullets
  - Improved handling of large numbers of similar sprites
  - Maintained compatibility with dirty rectangle rendering
  - Further reduced GPU load in high-density sprite scenarios

- **Debug Tools**

  - Added toggleable batch statistics display
  - Implemented hotkeys for enabling/disabling batch rendering
  - Enhanced performance monitoring to track batch statistics
  - Added real-time visualization of batching efficiency

- **General Improvements**
  - Further optimized memory usage with better cache management
  - Enhanced frame rate stability during intense gameplay
  - Improved overall rendering efficiency

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed performance bottlenecks when rendering many similar sprites
- Fixed excessive draw calls during high sprite density scenarios
- Fixed rendering inefficiencies with particle effects and bullets
- Fixed minor visual artifacts with optimized batch rendering

### Controls

- Arrow keys: Move ship
- Space: Shoot
- P: Pause game
- R: Restart (when game over)
- ESC: Quit game
- F: Toggle FPS display
- M: Toggle performance monitor
- D: Toggle debug visualization
- T: Toggle terminal reporting
- B: Toggle sprite batching
- V: Toggle batch statistics display
- C: Force full screen redraw

### Performance

The game now runs at even higher frame rates with significantly improved rendering efficiency. Scenarios with large numbers of similar sprites (such as bullet patterns or enemy swarms) show dramatic performance improvements thanks to the sprite batching system.

### Known Issues

- Some sound files may not be found if assets directory is missing
- Background music playback depends on having the appropriate sound files
- Batch rendering may not work optimally with heavily customized sprites
