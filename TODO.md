# Space Shooter - TODO List

## Performance Optimizations

- [x] **Sprite Batch Rendering**: Implement sprite batching to reduce draw calls when many similar sprites are present.
- [ ] **Memory Usage Optimization**: Profile memory usage during gameplay to identify and fix potential memory leaks.
- [ ] **Asset Preloading**: Implement a formal asset preloading system that loads all assets at startup rather than on-demand.
- [ ] **Texture Atlas Implementation**: Convert individual sprite images to a texture atlas to reduce texture switching.
- [ ] **Frame Limiting Improvement**: The current sleep-based frame limiting approach isn't precise - consider using pygame.time.Clock's tick method with proper delta-time handling.
- [ ] **Background Rendering**: Consider rendering the background as a single large texture only when needed, rather than as multiple star sprites.
- [ ] **Cache Optimization**: Implement intelligent cache eviction for image and text caches to prevent memory bloat.

## Code Structure & Maintenance

- [ ] **Code Organization**: Split main.py (1528 lines) into smaller, more manageable modules by separating game objects to their own files.
- [ ] **Game State Management**: Implement a proper game state machine to manage different game states (menu, gameplay, pause, etc.).
- [ ] **Configuration System**: Move all magic numbers and constants to game_config.py for easier tuning and maintenance.
- [ ] **Type Annotations**: Add type hints/annotations to improve code readability and enable static type checking.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive docstrings and improve existing documentation.
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for core game systems and logic.

## Features & Gameplay

- [ ] **Menu System**: Add a proper main menu with options for settings, high scores, etc.
- [ ] **Game Difficulty Settings**: Implement selectable difficulty levels.
- [ ] **Weapon Upgrade System**: Expand the power-up system to include persistent weapon upgrades.
- [ ] **Level System**: Add level progression with increasing difficulty.
- [ ] **Enemy Variety**: Implement more enemy types with unique behaviors.
- [ ] **Boss Variety**: Add multiple boss types with different attack patterns.
- [ ] **Audio System**: Implement a proper audio system with volume control and mute options.
- [ ] **Screen Resolution Options**: Add support for multiple screen resolutions and fullscreen mode.
- [ ] **Controller Support**: Add gamepad/controller support.

## Graphics & UI

- [ ] **UI Framework**: Implement a proper UI framework for menus and in-game elements.
- [ ] **HUD Improvements**: Enhance the heads-up display with more information and better visual design.
- [ ] **Animation System**: Implement a proper animation system for sprites.
- [ ] **Visual Effects**: Add more visual effects like particle systems for explosions, engine trails, etc.
- [ ] **Adaptive UI**: Ensure UI elements scale properly across different screen resolutions.

## Error Handling & Stability

- [ ] **Input Validation**: Add validation for user inputs in configuration settings.
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Improve error recovery mechanisms to prevent crashes during gameplay.
- [ ] **File I/O Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for file operations like loading/saving game state.
- [ ] **Logging Enhancements**: Implement log rotation and better log formatting.
- [ ] **Exception Specificity**: Create more specific exception types for better error diagnosis.

## Security

- [ ] **User Generated Content Validation**: If user-generated content is added (like custom skins), implement proper validation.
- [ ] **Config File Validation**: Add validation for config files to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] **Save Game File Security**: Implement checksums or encryption for save game files to prevent tampering.

## Performance Monitoring

- [ ] **Profiling Tools Integration**: Add integration with profiling tools like cProfile or line_profiler.
- [ ] **Automated Performance Testing**: Implement automated performance tests to catch regressions.
- [ ] **Memory Usage Tracking**: Add memory usage monitoring to detect memory leaks.
- [ ] **Bottleneck Visualization**: Improve the visualization of performance bottlenecks.

## Asset Management

- [ ] **Asset Version Control**: Implement version control for game assets.
- [ ] **Dynamic Asset Loading**: Load assets only when needed to reduce initial load time.
- [ ] **Fallback Assets**: Improve fallback mechanisms for missing assets.
- [ ] **Asset Compression**: Implement asset compression to reduce game size.

## Compatibility & Portability

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test the game on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- [ ] **PyGame Version Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with different PyGame versions.
- [ ] **Python Version Compatibility**: Test with different Python versions (3.7+).
- [ ] **Resolution Independence**: Make the game work well on various screen resolutions and aspect ratios.

## Community & Distribution

- [ ] **Packaging**: Set up proper packaging with PyInstaller or similar tools.
- [ ] **Update System**: Implement an auto-update system or update checker.
- [ ] **Community Features**: Add options for sharing high scores or replays.
- [ ] **Modding Support**: Create a mod API to allow the community to extend the game.
