## Features

- Smooth 60+ FPS gameplay with optimized rendering
- Diverse enemy types with different behaviors
- Power-up system with various buffs
- Performance monitoring and visualization tools
- Optimized collision detection using spatial partitioning
- Visual effects and animations

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pygame 2.0.0 or higher

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install pygame
```
3. Run the game:
```
python main.py
```

## Gameplay

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player ship
- **Space**: Shoot
- **P**: Pause the game
- **ESC**: Quit
- **R**: Restart (after game over)

### Debug Controls
- **F**: Toggle FPS display
- **T**: Toggle terminal FPS reporting
- **D**: Toggle debug visualization
- **R**: Toggle dirty rectangles visualization (when not in game over state)
- **C**: Force a full screen redraw
- **M**: Toggle performance monitor display

### Power-ups
- **Health**: Restores player health
- **Power**: Increases weapon power level
- **Shield**: Temporary invulnerability

## Performance Optimizations

This game implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Dirty Rectangle Rendering**: Only update portions of the screen that have changed, significantly reducing GPU workload.
2. **Spatial Partitioning**: Divides the game space into a grid for efficient collision detection, reducing the number of checks required.
3. **Asset Caching**: Frequently used images and text are cached to reduce loading times.
4. **Sprite Culling**: Off-screen sprites are skipped during rendering.
5. **Optimized Collision Detection**: Uses circle-based collision for better accuracy and performance.

## Debugging and Development

Use the performance monitor (toggle with M key) to track:
- FPS
- Frame times
- Update times
- Render times
- Collision detection times
